# THIS PLUGIN IS ARCHIVED.

Please use [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) instead.

# kubectl ctx plugin

Simple Plugin to display/change the current kube context in your KUBECONFIG.

# Installation

Pre-compiled statically linked binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/postfinance/kubectl-ctx/releases).
Binary must be placed anywhere in `$PATH` named `kubectl-ctx` with execute permissions.
For further information, see the offical documentation on plugins [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/).

# Compatibility

Known to work on Windows and Linux. Requires kubectl >= 1.12 (tested with versions >1.12).

# Examples

For all the examples, assume you have the following contexts.

```
foo
bar
baz
localhost
```

## display contexts

Current context is displayed in a different color.

```bash
$ kubectl ctx
bar
baz
foo
localhost
```

Substring matching can be used to display contexts. For example if you are searching a context named `ba` simply type:

```bash
$ kubectl ctx ba
bar
baz
```

## change current context

You can switch the context by providing an exact name:

```bash
$ kubectl ctx foo
current context set to "foo"
```

But it's also possible to switch to the `localhost` context by typing a substring (as long as it is a unique name), for example:

```bash
$ kubectl ctx local
current context set to "localhost"
```
